  Detect which tools a company runs from its own website and turn the stack into a qualification and an angle. Use when someone wants to know what CRM or sequencer or analytics a company uses, wants to find companies on a competitor, or wants tech stack based targeting.

# Tech Stack Signal Reader

## What this does

A detected tool is a fact; a useful signal is what the tool implies. This skill detects the stack from the live site, then reads it three ways: what it qualifies, what it disqualifies, and what it says about the company's maturity, which is usually the most useful of the three.

## When to use it

- what CRM do they use
- find companies using this tool
- detect their tech stack
- competitor displacement targeting
- what analytics are they running

## Inputs

- **domain**: the company domain
- **technologies**: the tools you care about detecting
- **meaning**: what each detection implies for your offer

## Shared context this skill reads

Before doing anything else, read whichever of these exist at the project root and
use them instead of asking the user to repeat themselves:

- `ICP.md`

If none exist, do the work from what the user gives you, then offer to write the
missing file so the next skill in the pack starts warmer.

## Tool connection

Detection reads the live site and its additional pages rather than a historical index, which is the difference between a current stack and one from two years ago.

This skill calls live data through the Mamba Labs MCP server, which runs the
actors on Apify with your own Apify token (https://console.apify.com/account/integrations).

- Installed as a plugin: the server is already wired, and the plugin asks for the token once.
- Installed by hand: copy `.mcp.json` from this folder into your project root and set
  `APIFY_TOKEN` in your environment, or run:

```
claude mcp add mamba-gtm-suite -e APIFY_TOKEN=<your token> -- npx -y @mambalabsdev/mcp-gtm-suite@1.10.0
```

| Actor | MCP tool | Used for | Store page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GTM Tech Stack Signal Enrichment | `detect_gtm_tech_stack` | tool detection from the live site, with additional page crawling | https://apify.com/mambalabs/gtm-tech-stack-signal-scraper |

Runnable example input:

```json
{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "technologies": [
    "hubspot",
    "segment",
    "intercom"
  ],
  "crawl_additional_pages": true
}
```

**Cost line.** Before any live call, state how many calls you plan and which actors
they bill. After the run, report the calls made, the calls that failed, and the Apify
usage where the tool reports it. Each actor bills the user's own Apify account at its
Store price.

**No token, no live data.** If no Apify token is available, say so and stop the live
steps. Never fill a live section from memory and present it as live.

## Method

1. Detect on the live site, and crawl beyond the homepage. Many tools only load on a pricing, signup or documentation page.
2. Split the results into qualifiers, disqualifiers and maturity markers before writing anything.
3. Treat a missing detection as unknown rather than as absence. A tool loaded behind a login will never be detected from outside.
4. Read the combination, not the items. A modern analytics stack next to a legacy CRM is a specific and actionable situation; either one alone is not.
5. Write the angle from the gap the combination implies, not from the tool name. Naming their CRM back to them proves you ran a scanner.
6. State detection confidence per tool, because a script tag is stronger evidence than a favicon.
7. Check the output with `scripts/check-output.py` before you return it.

## Approval stop

This skill does not send email or write to a CRM. If the user asks it to, stop first:
show what would be sent or written and wait for an explicit yes.

## Output

The detected stack with confidence per tool, the qualifier and disqualifier split, the maturity read, and one angle built from the combination.

## Check the output before you return it

Save the output to a file and run `python3 scripts/check-output.py <file>`. The
contract it checks is `scripts/output-contract.json`.

- Exit 0, `COMPLETE`: return the output.
- Exit 2, `INCOMPLETE`: do not present the output as finished. Fill what you can, run
  the check again, and if parts stay missing, return the output under the heading
  `Incomplete` with every reason the check printed.

## Quality bar

- A missing detection is reported as unknown, not as absence
- Pages beyond the homepage are crawled
- The angle comes from the combination rather than a single tool name
- Confidence is stated per detection
