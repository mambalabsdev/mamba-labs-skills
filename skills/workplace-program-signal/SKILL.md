# Workplace Program Signal

## What this does

For anyone selling to people operations, the buying signal is program presence or absence, and both are usually public across careers pages, benefits pages and job postings. This skill detects the programs, distinguishes a program that exists from one that is merely mentioned, and reads absence as the more actionable of the two.

## When to use it

- what benefits does this company offer
- HR buyer targeting
- benefits maturity check
- do they have this program
- people operations prospecting

## Inputs

- **domain**: the company domain
- **programs**: which programs to look for
- **direction**: whether presence or absence is your signal

## Shared context this skill reads

Before doing anything else, read whichever of these exist at the project root and
use them instead of asking the user to repeat themselves:

- `ICP.md`

If none exist, do the work from what the user gives you, then offer to write the
missing file so the next skill in the pack starts warmer.

## Tool connection

Programs are detected across the company's own pages and its job postings, which catches programs that are described in postings but never listed on a benefits page.

| Actor | MCP tool | Used for | Store page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workplace Program Detector | none, use `scripts/apify-run.py` | workplace program and benefit detection across web pages and job postings | https://apify.com/mambalabs/workplace-program-detector |

This actor has no MCP tool. Call it directly:

```
APIFY_TOKEN=<your token> python3 scripts/apify-run.py workplace-program-detector [input.json]
```

With no input file the script runs the example in `scripts/inputs/`. It exits non zero
on a failed or empty run, so an empty result is never read as an answer.

**Cost line.** Before any live call, state how many calls you plan and which actors
they bill. After the run, report the calls made, the calls that failed, and the Apify
usage where the tool reports it. Each actor bills the user's own Apify account at its
Store price.

**No token, no live data.** If no Apify token is available, say so and stop the live
steps. Never fill a live section from memory and present it as live.

## Method

1. Decide which direction is your signal before scanning. Selling a program platform means absence is the signal; selling program services means presence is.
2. Scan both pages and postings. Postings often describe a program that no page lists, and a page can describe a program that has been discontinued.
3. Distinguish existence from description. A benefits page listing a program is evidence it exists; a values page mentioning a concept is not.
4. Check headcount. Below a certain size, absence of a formal program is normal and not a signal at all.
5. Write the angle carefully. Program topics touch people's working conditions, so the message must be about the operational problem, not about implying a company treats people badly.
6. State detection confidence and where the evidence came from.
7. Check the output with `scripts/check-output.py` before you return it.

## Approval stop

This skill does not send email or write to a CRM. If the user asks it to, stop first:
show what would be sent or written and wait for an explicit yes.

## Output

The program table with present, absent or unknown per program, the evidence source, the headcount context, and the angle for the chosen direction.

## Check the output before you return it

Save the output to a file and run `python3 scripts/check-output.py <file>`. The
contract it checks is `scripts/output-contract.json`.

- Exit 0, `COMPLETE`: return the output.
- Exit 2, `INCOMPLETE`: do not present the output as finished. Fill what you can, run
  the check again, and if parts stay missing, return the output under the heading
  `Incomplete` with every reason the check printed.

## Quality bar

- The signal direction is set before scanning
- Pages and postings are both scanned and reported separately
- Absence is only a signal above the stated headcount floor
- The angle avoids implying anything about how a company treats its people
