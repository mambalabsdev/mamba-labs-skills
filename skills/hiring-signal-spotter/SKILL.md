# Hiring Signal Spotter

## What this does

Open roles are the most reliable public statement of what a company has decided to spend money on next quarter. This skill reads the roles from the applicant tracking system the company actually uses, separates the roles that mean something from the backfills that do not, and turns the surviving signal into one specific outreach angle.

## Requirements

Check these before you run the skill. Nothing outside this table is needed.

| Requirement | Needed | Used for | What it costs you |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Apify account and API token (`APIFY_TOKEN`) | Required | Runs the live data actors | A free Apify account works. Each run bills your own Apify account at the actor's Store price: gtm-hiring-signal-scraper 0.05 USD per company. |
| Node.js 18 or newer | Required | The MCP tool calls | Free. It starts the Mamba Labs MCP server with `npx`. |

**Missing a required item?** Stop before the live steps and tell the user which item is
missing and what it is for. Do not run the step without it and do not present an empty
result as an answer. Keys are read from the environment at run time and are never
written into a file, a prompt or the output.

## When to use it

- is this company hiring
- hiring signals for this domain
- are they investing in sales
- job board intent
- research this prospect before I reach out

## Inputs

- **domain**: the company domain
- **roles**: which role families matter for your offer

## Shared context this skill reads

Before doing anything else, read whichever of these exist at the project root and
use them instead of asking the user to repeat themselves:

- `ICP.md`

If none exist, do the work from what the user gives you, then offer to write the
missing file so the next skill in the pack starts warmer.

## Tool connection

Roles are read live from the company's own job board rather than from an aggregator, so the result reflects what is open today.

This skill calls live data through the Mamba Labs MCP server, which runs the
actors on Apify with your own Apify token (https://console.apify.com/account/integrations).

- Installed as a plugin: the server is already wired, and the plugin asks for the token once.
- Installed by hand: copy `.mcp.json` from this folder into your project root and set
  `APIFY_TOKEN` in your environment, or run:

```
claude mcp add mamba-gtm-suite -e APIFY_TOKEN=<your token> -- npx -y @mambalabsdev/mcp-gtm-suite@1.12.0
```

| Actor | MCP tool | Used for | Store page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GTM Hiring Signal Scraper | `scan_gtm_hiring_signals` | open roles from the company's applicant tracking system, filtered to the role families you care about | https://apify.com/mambalabs/gtm-hiring-signal-scraper |

Runnable example input, matched to the live tool schema:

`scan_gtm_hiring_signals`:

```json
{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "role_filter": [
    "sales",
    "marketing",
    "revops"
  ],
  "mode": "single",
  "include_role_details": true
}
```

**Cost line.** Before any live call, state how many calls you plan and which actors
they bill. After the run, report the calls made, the calls that failed, and the Apify
usage where the tool reports it. Each actor bills the user's own Apify account at its
Store price.

**No token, no live data.** If no Apify token is available, say so and stop the live
steps. Never fill a live section from memory and present it as live.

## Method

1. Pull the open roles. If the company has no discoverable job board, say so plainly rather than reporting zero roles as a finding, because absence of a board is not absence of hiring.
2. Separate net new roles from backfills where the posting makes it possible. A first sales hire and a fifth are different signals.
3. Read the seniority shape. Hiring a leader before the team means a function is being built; hiring the team before the leader means one is being scaled.
4. Read the copy of the posting itself, not just the title. The tools named in a job description are a tech stack signal, and the responsibilities are a statement of the problem they are hiring to solve.
5. Grade the signal: strong, moderate, or none, with the role that carries it named.
6. Write the outreach angle from the specific role, not from the fact of hiring. Referencing that they are hiring is generic; referencing what the role is being hired to fix is not.
7. Check the output with `scripts/check-output.py` before you return it.

## Approval stop

This skill does not send email or write to a CRM. If the user asks it to, stop first:
show what would be sent or written and wait for an explicit yes.

## Output

The role list with dates, the signal grade with the role that carries it, the stack hints found in the descriptions, and one outreach angle in two sentences.

## Check the output before you return it

Save the output to a file and run `python3 scripts/check-output.py <file>`. The
contract it checks is `scripts/output-contract.json`.

- Exit 0, `COMPLETE`: return the output.
- Exit 2, `INCOMPLETE`: do not present the output as finished. Fill what you can, run
  the check again, and if parts stay missing, return the output under the heading
  `Incomplete` with every reason the check printed.

## Quality bar

- No discoverable job board is reported as unknown, never as zero
- The signal grade names the specific role that carries it
- The outreach angle references what the role is for, not that hiring is happening
- Role descriptions are read, not only titles
