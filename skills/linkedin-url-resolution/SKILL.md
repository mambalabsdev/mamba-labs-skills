# LinkedIn URL Resolution

## What this does

Native enrichments resolve most domains to a company profile and quietly return nothing for the rest, and the rest is where the interesting companies often are. This skill resolves the list, reports the fill rate, and handles the specific cases that cause misses: holding company structures, country subsidiaries, and companies whose profile name does not resemble their domain.

## Requirements

Check these before you run the skill. Nothing outside this table is needed.

| Requirement | Needed | Used for | What it costs you |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Apify account and API token (`APIFY_TOKEN`) | Required | Runs the live data actors | A free Apify account works. Each run bills your own Apify account at the actor's Store price: domain-to-linkedin-url-resolver 0.006 USD per domain. |
| Node.js 18 or newer | Required | The MCP tool calls | Free. It starts the Mamba Labs MCP server with `npx`. |

**Missing a required item?** Stop before the live steps and tell the user which item is
missing and what it is for. Do not run the step without it and do not present an empty
result as an answer. Keys are read from the environment at run time and are never
written into a file, a prompt or the output.

## When to use it

- find LinkedIn URLs from domains
- my LinkedIn column has gaps
- domain to LinkedIn
- enrich with social data
- resolve company profiles

## Inputs

- **domains**: the domain list
- **names**: company names where available, which improve the match

## Shared context this skill reads

Before doing anything else, read whichever of these exist at the project root and
use them instead of asking the user to repeat themselves:

- `ICP.md`

If none exist, do the work from what the user gives you, then offer to write the
missing file so the next skill in the pack starts warmer.

## Tool connection

Resolution runs domain to company profile directly, and can return firmographics in the same call so a second enrichment is not needed.

This skill calls live data through the Mamba Labs MCP server, which runs the
actors on Apify with your own Apify token (https://console.apify.com/account/integrations).

- Installed as a plugin: the server is already wired, and the plugin asks for the token once.
- Installed by hand: copy `.mcp.json` from this folder into your project root and set
  `APIFY_TOKEN` in your environment, or run:

```
claude mcp add mamba-gtm-suite -e APIFY_TOKEN=<your token> -- npx -y @mambalabsdev/mcp-gtm-suite@1.10.0
```

| Actor | MCP tool | Used for | Store page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Domain to LinkedIn URL Resolver | `resolve_linkedin_url` | company domain to company profile URL, with optional firmographics | https://apify.com/mambalabs/domain-to-linkedin-url-resolver |

Runnable example input, matched to the live tool schema:

`resolve_linkedin_url`:

```json
{
  "company_domain": "example.com",
  "company_name": "Example Co",
  "includeFirmographics": "true"
}
```

**Cost line.** Before any live call, state how many calls you plan and which actors
they bill. After the run, report the calls made, the calls that failed, and the Apify
usage where the tool reports it. Each actor bills the user's own Apify account at its
Store price.

**No token, no live data.** If no Apify token is available, say so and stop the live
steps. Never fill a live section from memory and present it as live.

## Method

1. Normalize domains before resolving: lowercase, strip protocol, strip the www prefix, and drop tracking parameters.
2. Pass the company name alongside the domain where you have it. The pair resolves materially better than the domain alone.
3. Report the fill rate before and after. The point of this skill is the gap it closes, so the gap has to be measured.
4. Handle the three miss patterns: a holding company domain whose profile is under a trading name, a country subsidiary that shares a domain with a global parent, and a company whose profile name shares no tokens with its domain.
5. Decide the parent versus subsidiary rule up front, because both are correct answers to different questions and mixing them corrupts follower and headcount data.
6. Spot check a sample by hand. Resolution rates look fine right up until they are matching the wrong entity.
7. Check the output with `scripts/check-output.py` before you return it.

## Approval stop

This skill does not send email or write to a CRM. If the user asks it to, stop first:
show what would be sent or written and wait for an explicit yes.

## Output

The resolved table with domain, profile URL, matched name and confidence; the fill rate before and after; the unresolved list with its miss pattern; and the sample check result.

## Check the output before you return it

Save the output to a file and run `python3 scripts/check-output.py <file>`. The
contract it checks is `scripts/output-contract.json`.

- Exit 0, `COMPLETE`: return the output.
- Exit 2, `INCOMPLETE`: do not present the output as finished. Fill what you can, run
  the check again, and if parts stay missing, return the output under the heading
  `Incomplete` with every reason the check printed.

## Quality bar

- Fill rate is reported before and after
- The parent versus subsidiary rule is decided and stated
- Unresolved rows are labeled with a miss pattern rather than left blank
- A hand checked sample is included
