# Legal Entity Resolution

## What this does

The trading name on a website and the registered entity that signs a contract are frequently different, and the gap is where invoicing, tax and diligence problems live. This skill resolves the domain to the register record, validates the tax identifier where it can, and states the jurisdiction rather than assuming one.

## Requirements

Check these before you run the skill. Nothing outside this table is needed.

| Requirement | Needed | Used for | What it costs you |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Apify account and API token (`APIFY_TOKEN`) | Required | Runs the live data actors | A free Apify account works. Each run bills your own Apify account at the actor's Store price: legal-entity-resolver 0.007 USD per domain. |
| Node.js 18 or newer | Required | The MCP tool calls | Free. It starts the Mamba Labs MCP server with `npx`. |

**Missing a required item?** Stop before the live steps and tell the user which item is
missing and what it is for. Do not run the step without it and do not present an empty
result as an answer. Keys are read from the environment at run time and are never
written into a file, a prompt or the output.

## When to use it

- what is their legal entity
- company registration number
- VAT number for this company
- supplier due diligence
- legal name for the contract

## Inputs

- **domain**: the company domain
- **jurisdiction**: the expected country of registration, if known
- **strictness**: whether a near name match is acceptable

## Shared context this skill reads

Before doing anything else, read whichever of these exist at the project root and
use them instead of asking the user to repeat themselves:


If none exist, do the work from what the user gives you, then offer to write the
missing file so the next skill in the pack starts warmer.

## Tool connection

The register lookup and tax identifier validation run live against the public registers rather than a cached copy.

This skill calls live data through the Mamba Labs MCP server, which runs the
actors on Apify with your own Apify token (https://console.apify.com/account/integrations).

- Installed as a plugin: the server is already wired, and the plugin asks for the token once.
- Installed by hand: copy `.mcp.json` from this folder into your project root and set
  `APIFY_TOKEN` in your environment, or run:

```
claude mcp add mamba-gtm-suite -e APIFY_TOKEN=<your token> -- npx -y @mambalabsdev/mcp-gtm-suite@1.12.0
```

| Actor | MCP tool | Used for | Store page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Legal Entity Resolver | `resolve_legal_entity` | domain to registered entity, company number and validated tax identifier | https://apify.com/mambalabs/legal-entity-resolver |

Runnable example input, matched to the live tool schema:

`resolve_legal_entity`:

```json
{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "jurisdiction_hint": "GB",
  "match_strictness": "exact",
  "validate_vat": true
}
```

**Cost line.** Before any live call, state how many calls you plan and which actors
they bill. After the run, report the calls made, the calls that failed, and the Apify
usage where the tool reports it. Each actor bills the user's own Apify account at its
Store price.

**No token, no live data.** If no Apify token is available, say so and stop the live
steps. Never fill a live section from memory and present it as live.

## Method

1. Resolve against the register for the jurisdiction, and state which register was used. A match in the wrong register is worse than no match.
2. Prefer an exact name match. A near match on a common trading name will find a different company with a similar name, and that error is expensive downstream.
3. Validate the tax identifier rather than reporting the one on the website, because website tax numbers are frequently stale or belong to a different group entity.
4. Where a group structure exists, report the entity that matches the domain and note the parent rather than silently returning either.
5. Report status. A dissolved or dormant entity is a material finding for diligence and a blocker for a contract.
6. Return nothing rather than a low confidence match, and say what additional input would resolve it.
7. Check the output with `scripts/check-output.py` before you return it.

## Approval stop

This skill does not send email or write to a CRM. If the user asks it to, stop first:
show what would be sent or written and wait for an explicit yes.

## Output

The entity record with registered name, number, jurisdiction, status and validated tax identifier, the group note where applicable, and the confidence.

## Check the output before you return it

Save the output to a file and run `python3 scripts/check-output.py <file>`. The
contract it checks is `scripts/output-contract.json`.

- Exit 0, `COMPLETE`: return the output.
- Exit 2, `INCOMPLETE`: do not present the output as finished. Fill what you can, run
  the check again, and if parts stay missing, return the output under the heading
  `Incomplete` with every reason the check printed.

## Quality bar

- The register used is named
- The tax identifier is validated, not copied from the website
- Entity status is reported
- A low confidence result returns nothing and names the missing input
